Advanced interaction:
	- Physics (push enemies around as well as yourself with the rocket launcher and grapple hook)
	- Implemented A* search
	- TCells implement object tracking
	- Steering behaviour:
		- A* search
		- Collision avoidance
		- Navmesh
	- Also I may add the launchpads

Use of multimedia:
	- Imported models and animations (animations for walkers)
	- Particle effects, i.e. complex animations involving billboarding etc.
	- Imported textures
	- Text for story telling
	- If I manage to get the animations working for my bacteriophage then I'm definitely good for this one
	- Unity terrain objects
		- Texture mapping, terrain deformation etc.
		- Could add foliage and do some billboaring
	- Self-made complex scene objects (with a the unity library thingy)
		- i.e. stairs, arches, whatever else I do

Game Interaction:
	- Controls (WASD, dashes, grapple hook, movement)
	- Brief mention of AI (in the context of passive interaction)
		- Give a general overview of an abstract controller in this games
		- Talk about shooting
	- Jump pads
